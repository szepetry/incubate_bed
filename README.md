# incubate_bed

A project made for a hackathon called incubateIND.

This project uses Google places API to get the location of nearby hospitals and displays the availability of beds and other facilities.

Uses:
- Google Maps Flutter, along with its markers.
- Google places API: Make sure you have a billing account associated to your Google cloud, if not it wouldn't work.
